# Intelligent Business Card OCR System with Entity Recognition

A web application that automatically extracts contact information from business card images using OCR and machine learning.

## What it does

Upload a business card image and the system will:

• Detect and crop the business card from the photo
• Extract text using OCR technology  
• Identify and highlight specific information like names, phone numbers, emails, job titles, companies, and websites
• Display the results with color-coded boxes around each type of information

The app saves time by automatically digitizing business card information instead of manually typing it out.
